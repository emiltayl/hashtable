This project is a simple thing I put together to get an understanding of how
hash tables work, and to see if I could put it all together myself.

It is not very advanced, as I've tried to keep things at a bare minimum of what
is required of it. Currently it is not possible to store anything to keys, but
adding that posibility should not be much harder than adding an extra field to
hash_table_list_t and modifying the functions to set the field.

I do not claim any rights over this code.
